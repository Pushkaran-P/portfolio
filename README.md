## Education
- Integrated Masters, Data Science | PSG College Of Technology (_June 2023_)

## Projects
### [Age Classification](https://github.com/Pushkaran-P/Age-Race-Classification)
- Leveraged open source UTKFace Dataset, which contains 36,000 images of individuals ranging from 1 to 116 years old,
to develop a model for age prediction using TensorFlow
- Applied Face Detection, Interpolation, GAN, and undersampling for data pre-processing, resulting in a 20% enhancement
in the F1 score
- Executed CNN with padding, fully convolutional networks, progressive resizing, and transfer learning, leading to a further
10% improvement in F1 score, and developed a web app using FastAPI and used Docker for containerization.

### [Research Paper Recommendation System](https://github.com/Pushkaran-P/Research-Paper-Recommendation)
![Demo](/assets/chatbot.gif)
- Extracted data from research paper websites for scraping with Selenium and Chromium used various text pre-processing techniques to clean and normalize the data for analysis
- Systemized TF-IDF and cosine similarity to measure the relevance of papers based on the userâ€™s input query and generated a ranked list of recommendations for each topic
- Devised RAG with LLM to enhance the quality and diversity of the recommendations with ChromaDB.

### [Energy Consumption Forecasting](https://github.com/Pushkaran-P/Energy-Consumption-Forecasting)
![Forecast](/assets/forecast.png)
- Built a model to forecast city-wide energy consumption using the NYC energy consumption dataset that contains data on electricity usage on nearly 30,000 of the tallest buildings in NYC
- Illustrated further insights on data through STL decomposition alongside using ACF and PACF plots to decide parameters, which helped in a 30% reduction in runtime
- Delivered a SARIMAX model for accurate predictions to achieve a 92% MAPE score.

### [Customer Segmentation and Market Basket Analysis](https://github.com/Pushkaran-P/Customer-Segmentation)
- The goal of this project is to classify customers of an Online Retail Store and study their granular purchase behavior using Python
- By analyzing customer segmentation and market basket data, we aim to devise strategies that uncover a deeper understanding of purchase decisions,
determine appropriate product pricing, and make recommendations.

### [Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Components](https://github.com/Pushkaran-P/Predictive-Maintenance-of-Industrial-Components)
- Objective: The goal of this project is to analyze the degradation of an industrial component over the course of a year.By answering questions such as
whether the component has been replaced at some point, and if its wear can be accurately predicted, we aim to determine maintenance windows through predictive maintenance
- Methodology: To achieve our objective, we will implement K-Means Clustering with k=1 and One Class SVM with RBF Kernalization.
