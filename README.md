# Data Scientist

Hello!ðŸ˜‡ Iâ€™m Pushkaran P, a dedicated Data Scientist  with a year of internship experience at Capgemini and iamneo.ai. I hold an Integrated Masters in Data Science from PSG College Of Technology. Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve tackled projects involving Machine Learning Data Analysis, Data Engineering, Data Visualization, Data Modeling, Computer Vision, Time Series Forecasting, Natural Language Processing, and Predictive Models.

#### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, PowerBI, Tableu, Docker, AWS

## Certifications
- Generative AI with Large Language Models (DeepLearning.AI)

## Experience
**Data Scientist @ Capgemini (_January 2023 - July 2023_)**
- Executed advanced Time Series Forecasting techniques, including data preprocessing and model selection, resulting in a 
15% improvement in demand forecasting accuracy
- Directed comprehensive time series analysis, identifying key patterns and recommending specific data preprocessing 
techniques, resulting in a 10% improvement in forecasting accuracy
- Utilized Silverkite and NeuralProphet for sales prediction, optimized runtime by 40% and presented project summary to 
stakeholders

**AI/ML Developer @ iamneo.ai (_May 2021 - November 2021_)**
- Communicated with a team to design and implement Power BI dashboards for ten college administrators over two weeks, 
enhancing data visualization and streamlining decision-making processes
- Engineered an AI Interviewer with Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, analyzing speech and emotion and 
optimized runtime from 60 to 15 seconds, achieving a 75% efficiency gain
- Operated an attendance calculator using Face Recognition and one-shot learning with Siamese Networks for classroom 
presence tracking with 94% accuracy and presented a project report to the college.

## Projects
### Age Classification
[Project Link](https://github.com/Pushkaran-P/Age-Race-Classification)
- Leveraged open source UTKFace Dataset, which contains 36,000 images of individuals ranging from 1 to 116 years old,
to develop a model for age prediction using TensorFlow
- Applied Face Detection, Interpolation, GAN, and undersampling for data pre-processing, resulting in a 20% enhancement
in the F1 score
- Executed CNN with padding, fully convolutional networks, progressive resizing, and transfer learning, leading to a further
10% improvement in F1 score, and developed a web app using FastAPI and used Docker for containerization.

### Research Paper Recommendation System

- Extracted data from research paper websites for scraping with Selenium and Chromium used various text pre-processing techniques to clean and normalize the data for analysis
- Systemized TF-IDF and cosine similarity to measure the relevance of papers based on the userâ€™s input query and generated a ranked list of recommendations for each topic
- Devised RAG with LLM to enhance the quality and diversity of the recommendations with ChromaDB.

### Energy Consumption Forecasting
[Project Link](https://github.com/Pushkaran-P/Energy-Consumption-Forecasting)
- ![EEG Band Discovery](/assets/forecast.png)
- Built a model to forecast city-wide energy consumption using the NYC energy consumption dataset that contains data on electricity usage on nearly 30,000 of the tallest buildings in NYC
- Illustrated further insights on data through STL decomposition alongside using ACF and PACF plots to decide parameters, which helped in a 30% reduction in runtime
- Delivered a SARIMAX model for accurate predictions to achieve a 92% MAPE score.
