## Projects
### Age Classification
[Project Link](https://github.com/Pushkaran-P/Age-Race-Classification)
- ![EEG Band Discovery](/assets/img/eeg_band_discovery.jpeg)
- Leveraged open source UTKFace Dataset, which contains 36,000 images of individuals ranging from 1 to 116 years old,
to develop a model for age prediction using TensorFlow
- Applied Face Detection, Interpolation, GAN, and undersampling for data pre-processing, resulting in a 20% enhancement
in the F1 score
- Executed CNN with padding, fully convolutional networks, progressive resizing, and transfer learning, leading to a further
10% improvement in F1 score, and developed a web app using FastAPI and used Docker for containerization.

### Research Paper Recommendation System

- ![EEG Band Discovery](/assets/img/eeg_band_discovery.jpeg)
- Extracted data from research paper websites for scraping with Selenium and Chromium used various text pre-processing techniques to clean and normalize the data for analysis
- Systemized TF-IDF and cosine similarity to measure the relevance of papers based on the userâ€™s input query and generated a ranked list of recommendations for each topic
- Devised RAG with LLM to enhance the quality and diversity of the recommendations with ChromaDB.

### Energy Consumption Forecasting
[Project Link](https://github.com/Pushkaran-P/Energy-Consumption-Forecasting)
- ![EEG Band Discovery](/assets/img/eeg_band_discovery.jpeg)
- Built a model to forecast city-wide energy consumption using the NYC energy consumption dataset that contains data on electricity usage on nearly 30,000 of the tallest buildings in NYC
- Illustrated further insights on data through STL decomposition alongside using ACF and PACF plots to decide parameters, which helped in a 30% reduction in runtime
- Delivered a SARIMAX model for accurate predictions to achieve a 92% MAPE score.
